Facebook for Code Igniter
##################
This project is a sample to how to use the Facebook SDK with CodeIgniter. The code is commented and is based on a post from Danny Herran, http://www.dannyherran.com/2011/02/facebook-php-sdk-and-codeigniter-for-basic-user-authentication/ . You only will need to change the config file "facebook.php" and the views to test the API. The controller "home" do all the visual work  and the model "Facebook_model" do the Facebook tasks. If you have any other suggestion or question, please contact me at bruno.luiz.one@gmail.com.

AHHH! Don't forget to edit the config file. I'm repeating, but DON'T FORGET. The information below is from CodeIgniter README.

What is CodeIgniter
###################

CodeIgniter is an Application Development Framework - a toolkit - for people
who build web sites using PHP. Its goal is to enable you to develop projects
much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing
a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple
interface and logical structure to access these libraries. CodeIgniter lets
you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed
for a given task.
